## YouTube Videos

This project will help get video info from youtube. The reason we're using scrap method instead of youtube data api because youtube data api cost is too high (for search endpoints it costs 100 credits). 

We'll use this to scrap videos list given by a channel. Once we've video id, we can use one the following approach to get video details:

- similarly scrap video details 
- use data api to get details as the cost is reasonable.
